## Instructions for running my (bhayward7) code for assignment 3 - Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction

1. Access my public GitHub repository for CS 7641 assignment 3 files at https://github.com/nederedu/machine-learning/tree/main/assignment-3
2. Download the files onto a linux machine.
3. In a terminal, access the directory where you've stored the files. 
4. In the directory, you will see my README.md file, a folder containing my original datasets, and a folder for each of the assignment tasks. In each of the task folders, you will find the relevant Python programs for performing the experiments and an accompanying Jupyter notebook that walks you through the steps for each task.
5. As you complete each step in the Jupyter notebooks, it will produce results files (either CSV or PNG, depending on the task) and save them in the same folder.

I included a link to my overleaf project in the comment in my Canvas submission.
