## Instructions for running my (bhayward7) code for assignment 2 - Randomized Optimization

1. Access my public GitHub repository for CS 7641 assignments at https://github.com/nederedu/machine-learning/tree/main
2. Download the files onto a linux machine. The folders that are relevant for assignment 2 are "4-peaks", "k-color", and "neural-network". 
    - I have included a CSV file that contains my insurance dataset in each folder, to prevent potential issues with import file paths.
3. In a terminal, access the directories where you've stored the files. 
4. Run each of the programs separately (e.g. python3 4-peaks-problem-size-4.py)
    - Alternatively, I have included an iPython jupyter notebook for each part of the problem where you can run each of my python files and view results.

I included a link to my overleaf project in the comment in my Canvas submission.
